Till I die and after I die, and when I find my way out of the land of the dead, I‚Äôll drift about forever, all my atoms, till I find you again‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be looking for you, every moment, every single moment. And when we do find each other again, we‚Äôll cling together so tight that nothing and no one‚Äôll ever tear us apart. Every atom of me and every atom of you‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll live in birds and flowers and dragonflies and pine trees and in clouds and in those little specks of light you see floating in sunbeams‚Ä¶ And when they use our atoms to make new lives, they won‚Äôt just be able to take one, they‚Äôll have to take two, one of you and one of me.\nOur wedding day was one of the best days of our lives, and was intertwined with the many changes that led us on the journey we‚Äôre on now. Finding each other gave us the courage to take the risks necessary to live the life we want and this passage is very meaningful to us. When we decided to leave to travel in our van, and to document our journey along the way, the name ‚Äúatoms of us‚Äù seemed fitting, as it encompassses everything that makes us who we are - all of our values, decisions, people we meet, mistakes we make along the way. We would like to share with you some of the atoms of us, and hope we can continue growing and learning along with you.\nChan Kyle Marty Fun Facts üèûÔ∏èü¶¨ 12 National Parks üöêüèïÔ∏è 365 days on the road ü•æ 30 miles hiked üõ£Ô∏è 3000 miles driven ","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://atomsofus.com/images/about-us_hu14c33cb288d7aa9b8a1f0f995e7e9f3d_699476_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp","permalink":"/about/","title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://atomsofus.com/images/about-us_hu14c33cb288d7aa9b8a1f0f995e7e9f3d_699476_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp","permalink":"/contact/","title":"Contact"},{"categories":null,"contents":" PRIVACY NOTICE\nLast updated September 20, 2022\nThis privacy notice for Atoms of Us (\"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\"), describes how and why we might collect, store, use, and/or share (\"process\") your information when you use our services (\"Services\"), such as when you:Visit our website at atomsofus.com, or any website of ours that links to this privacy noticeEngage with us in other related ways, including any sales, marketing, or eventsQuestions or concerns?¬†Reading this privacy notice will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.
