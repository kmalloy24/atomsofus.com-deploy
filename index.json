In June, we set off on the adventure of a lifetime. Now, nearly 4 months and over 60 hikes later, everything has changed. If you had met us before we set out on this journey, you never would have guessed that we would spend the summer hiking (and that eventually, any day we didn‚Äôt get out for a hike, we would feel like something was missing!)\nWhen we were living in Boston, we started to feel disconnected - from nature, from each other, from ourselves. One of our top priorities when we decided to become nomads was to get back in touch with the outdoors and to see as many national parks as we could. Almost immediately, we knew we were hooked. The fresh air, the peace and quiet (well, depending on how crowded the national park was that day..), the feeling of balance; it was like having the most pure form of therapy at the tip of our hiking boots.\nOf the many miles we have traveled so far, the ones taken by foot are, by far, our favorite. We still have many more yet to explore, but we have already seen so many beautiful and transformative places on our travels. We wanted to sum up some of our favorite hikes. Below is a map and list of our top 8 favorite hikes of 2022. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to see every hike we\u0026rsquo;ve done to date, we keep a running list here.\n*All photo creds are our own.\n8. Avalanche Peak Trail Location | Yellowstone National Park, WY Challenge level | Hard Mileage | 4.5 miles Elevation Gain | 2,070 feet Pet friendly? | No Let‚Äôs be clear, although this hike is at the bottom of this list, it is far from boring (it‚Äôs just that we have so many good ones to choose from!) Avalanche Peak was definitely a challenge for us as it has a pretty steep incline. Near the top of the peak, you reach a rocky, narrow ridge which could be a bit nerve wracking for some (Chan has a slight fear of heights in these situations) but the view made it all worth it. Be prepared for some light scrambling over boulders at times. Located on the East side of the park, this was one of the less crowded hikes we went on in Yellowstone, so it‚Äôs a great option if you‚Äôre looking for a little more solitude.\n7. Jenny Lake to Cascade Canyon Location | Grand Teton National Park, WY Challenge level | Hard Mileage | 17 miles Elevation Gain | 1,725 feet Pet friendly? | No For this hike, we decided to combine two separate trails - Jenny Lake and Cascade Canyon - which ended up being quite the trek. If you‚Äôre not looking to do this many miles, you can find each trail separately, with Jenny Lake being a less challenging loop. You can also take the ferry across the lake, so you can cut out part of the loop or just do Cascade Canyon on its own (the ferry does cost money though, so be sure to check on the national parks website for the most updated price). It‚Äôs nice to know that you have the option to take the ferry back if you get tuckered out! The trail is slightly crowded in sections around the lake, but gets less populated as you get further into Cascade Canyon. There is a nice little shady spot at the end perfect for refueling before you head back. A good amount of this hike is through the woods, but you do get to see the mountains and the lake in certain sections along the way.\n6. Fairyland Loop Trail Location | Bryce Canyon National Park, UT Challenge level | Moderate Mileage | 7.8 miles Elevation Gain | 1,545 feet Pet friendly? | No Bryce Canyon was one of those national parks where you will distinctly remember the landscape. The unique formations transform Bryce into a land of castles and towers, where royal children may be trapped, guarded by some mythical dragon! Okay, maybe we‚Äôre taking the name of this loop a little too literally, but seriously, out of all the places we‚Äôve been to so far, this was probably one of the most memorable. The Fairyland Loop takes you down into the canyon. We went early in the morning, not long after sunrise, and it was incredible to see the colors change as the sun hit in different places. If you‚Äôre going during the warmer months, make sure to go early or later in the evening, as there‚Äôs not a whole lot of shade along the way.\n5. Historic Donner Pass Trail Location | Donner Memorial State Park, CA Challenge level | Moderate Mileage | 6.3 miles Elevation Gain | 980 feet Pet friendly? | Yes (off-leash in some areas) If you‚Äôve never heard of the Donner Party, it‚Äôs worth a Google (be prepared, it is gruesome). This tragic story is one that sticks out from the history lessons in school. The Historic Donner Pass Trail takes you through old railroad tunnels which are now home to many different works of graffiti. Be sure to bring a flashlight, as it can get a bit dark in the tunnels at times. We hiked this trail on October 1st, which felt like the perfect way to kick off spooky season! It is pretty well traveled, so you probably won‚Äôt be the only ones going through the tunnels. There are breaks between the tunnels where you can catch some great views of Donner Lake. If you continue on beyond the end of the tunnels, be aware that the trail is not super well marked. We got lost and certainly took a way back that we would not recommend, but otherwise it is pretty easy to navigate.\n4. Lady Bird Johnson Grove Trail Location | Redwood National Park, CA Challenge level | Easy Mileage | 1.5 miles Elevation Gain | 100 feet Pet friendly? | No This was another milestone for us, and Kyle‚Äôs first time on the California coast (which he was very excited for üòÅ). The iconic redwoods did not disappoint, and were more beautiful in person than any image can do justice. The trail is spacious, flat, and mostly clear of tripping hazards so you can calmly stroll through the trees with your neck cranked up looking around without having to worry about rolling your ankle and ruining your cross country road trip for your partner.\n3. Skyline Trail Loop Location | Mount Rainier National Park, WA Challenge level | Hard Mileage | 6.2 miles Elevation Gain | 1,790 feet Pet friendly? | No This hike is the one with the most Alltrails reviews on this list, and rightfully so. Arrive at Paradise earlier than you think you need to if you are going to hike it in the summer like we did. We like to get the hard work out of the way first which means going clockwise on this one. After a steep paved section to start you‚Äôll be greeted with a variety of wildflowers (depending on the season), cool, high elevation air, snow patches, rocky outcrops, and stream crossings. This was the definitive alpine hike for us so far for sure. The hype from the John Muir quote engraved on the stone steps to start the trail is real.\n‚Äú\u0026quot;\u0026hellip; the most luxuriant and the most extravagantly beautiful of all the alpine gardens I ever beheld in all my mountain-top wanderings.\u0026quot; - John Muir (1889)\n2. Navajo Knobs Trail Location | Capitol Reef National Park, UT Challenge level | Hard Mileage | 9.1 miles Elevation Gain | 2,140 feet Pet friendly? | No Our favorite hike in Utah. There are more popular parks, and more instagramable photo ops, in The Mighty 5. But if you are looking to skip the crowds, get a good workout, and become engrossed in a cool landscape with amazing views ‚Äì trust us, you can‚Äôt miss Navajo Knobs in Capitol Reef. There is also a great free camping spot right outside the park‚Ä¶but you didn‚Äôt hear it from us ü§´.\n1. Plain of Six Glaciers, Highline, Beehive, and Lake Agnes Trail Location | Banff National Park, AB (Canada) Challenge level | Hard Mileage | 11.8 miles Elevation Gain | 3,230 feet Pet friendly? | Yes (on leash) Banff National Park was one of our top bucket list locations to get to this summer! It looked so picturesque and the images of Lake Louise are all but iconic. One of the biggest draws, however, was the fact that you can hike to not one, but two historic teahouses (Lake Agnes Teahouse and Plain of Six Glaciers Teahouse). Only accessible on foot, these charming little establishments make you feel like you‚Äôve landed in a secluded alpine village. We got hot tea and scones at the first teahouse, and chili at the second one - and food never tastes so good as when you‚Äôve hiked to get it! Be prepared to pack out your trash. The views were incredible and, if you push yourself past the second teahouse, you get to see a glacier viewpoint. For those who are looking for less of a challenge, you can still hike to the first teahouse in 4.6 miles (roundtrip) via the Lake Agnes Trail - just get there early if you want to beat the crowds.\nIt was incredibly hard to narrow down our favorite hikes, as any time we can get out in nature is enjoyable for us! Have a favorite hike you\u0026rsquo;ve done in 2022? Or maybe we passed one another on one of these trails this summer. Let us know on instagram! You\u0026rsquo;ll also find more pictures from our adventures, and can see our new addition to the family‚Ä¶ (Hint: üê∂)\n","date":"October 24, 2022","image":"https://atomsofus.com/images/post/top-8-2022/banner_hu947c351285b249a47b91d201e28a4d91_755362_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp","permalink":"/blog/top-8-2022/","title":"Our 8 Favorite Hikes of 2022"},{"categories":["hiking"],"contents":"Drop us a line on instagram if you are planning to take one of these hikes yourself!\n","date":"October 21, 2022","image":"https://atomsofus.com/images/post/hikes-so-far/banner_huca6e8a6fe7d6aa1a0330b7466b08c378_994094_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp","permalink":"/blog/hikes-so-far/","title":"All of Our Hikes to Date"},{"categories":["Vanlife"],"contents":"It has been three months since we quit our jobs, sold (almost) all of our belongings, and hit the road to travel America in our converted van. We never knew that 3 months could go by so fast, while simultaneously feeling like a century has passed. Every single day on the road brings new challenges and problems to solve, but we wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way!\nIn April, we quit our jobs and began the process of downsizing from a 3 bedroom apartment to a single van. It was a daunting task which we faced with courage and perhaps naive excitement. In May, we took an Amtrak from Boston all the way to New Mexico, and what a way to begin. Sleeping on a train for 2 days, eating microwaved meals, overpriced alcohol, it all seems rudimentary now that we‚Äôve been on the road. We look back on that and think, wow, we had no idea what we were in for!\n(Chan\u0026rsquo;s entire downsized wardrobe!)\nIn June, we set off from New Mexico to begin our journey. We had a rough idea of where we wanted to go and what we wanted to do and see, but at the same time, we knew nothing! We wanted to focus on hitting national parks and outdoor spots, but there are so many incredible destinations, it was overwhelming to try to narrow it down. We logged a few things into a map, did a little research on some campsites, and hit the open road. Below, you can see the route we have traveled so far:\nTrip map created using Wanderlog, for making itineraries on iOS and Android We estimated the rough stats from our trip so far:\nü¶¨ 12 national parks visited üõ£Ô∏è 5500 miles driven ü•æ 200 miles hiked üåé 6 states üó∫Ô∏è 2 countries From BLM land, to campgrounds, Airbnbs and Hipcamps, to dingy, cigarette-smelling chalets, and Walmart parking lots, we have certainly experienced a lot - but there‚Äôs always more to come. We‚Äôve learned the luxury of flush toilets and a hot shower, how good a hot cup of coffee tastes on a crisp morning in the mountains, and the heart-stopping fear you experience when the sound of a deer walking by your tent sounds like a grizzly to your ears. We‚Äôve woken up with cows outside our van, chickens walking by our tent, and over-friendly chipmunks running across our laps. We‚Äôve met wonderful people in the most unexpected places, and have come to know the camaraderie you feel with your fellow nomads. What a wonderful experience it has been.\nTo look at the stats and think about the days when we were both so drained we wouldn‚Äôt even leave the house makes us realize how much we needed this change. We wake up every morning now excited and invigorated, knowing that we get to choose how to spend the day and have the freedom to go wherever we want.\nBefore setting off on this journey, we had no idea how it would go. We took a giant leap of faith, trusting that we had each other so everything would work out in the end. We left our jobs, our security, and our possessions behind, yearning to take back our freedom and regain our zest for life.\nThe van had been stationed in New Mexico with my brother, while we were in Massachusetts. That meant, aside from some pictures and a video walkthrough, we had never seen it in person. We had no idea if we would like this lifestyle, if things would go disastrously wrong. Yet that was part of the draw. The uncertainty made us feel alive again.\nAt some point, we both started to feel like we were living life on rails, to get to some predetermined definition of success. We had strived our whole lives to get to this place, and the closer we got to it, the more we realized that it wasn‚Äôt what we wanted.\nAfter making the decision to take this leap, we were faced with the task of paring down 90% of our things. It was difficult at first, but as we purged more and more, we started to feel free, weightless. You don‚Äôt realize how many empty possessions you‚Äôve accumulated, until you have to figure out if you have room for it in a Chevy Express‚Ä¶ The less things we had, the more we could prioritize, and figure out, what really matters to us.\nEvery moment we get on this planet is precious, and we want to be able to spend it enjoying the many precious things - like each other, our loved ones, the beautiful natural wonders of the world. We are certainly not seasoned nomads as of yet, but we have recognized that the challenges that come with living this way are challenges that we welcome with open arms. These are the challenges that make us grow, force us to problem solve and work together.\nIn 3 months, we have grown so much. Kyle lived in Massachusetts his whole life and hadn‚Äôt gotten a chance to explore the country much, so this road trip has opened up a whole new world for him. While I moved around a lot growing up, many of the places we have been to so far have been new for me, as well. Getting to spend so much time in nature has been therapeutic - it is our new addiction. It has given us a new appreciation and respect for just how wonderful this planet is.\nWe‚Äôre not sure where this adventure will take us, or how long we‚Äôll be on the road, but we know that we want to live our lives with meaning and intention. Part of the motivation for starting this blog was to have a living journal to share with others and our future selves, but we also hope to contribute something positive to the world.\nWe are headed to our first van meetup this week, the Northwest Nomads event, and are excited to meet some other like-minded people, hopefully make some friends along the way. From there, we will head into California, on to Utah and Arizona, and head back to New Mexico for a quick recharge with family for Thanksgiving. So much has already changed in 3 months, we can only imagine what the next 3 has to hold - and we can‚Äôt wait to find out!\n-Chan\n","date":"September 20, 2022","image":"https://atomsofus.com/images/post/post-1/banner_huede4951c723fcfe00301b0ec241ca2bb_450918_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp","permalink":"/blog/post-1/","title":"Our Journery So Far (The First 3 Months in the Van)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Us Hi, we‚Äôre Chan and Kyle! We love travel, coffee, beer, and adventure! In 2022, we quit our jobs, sold everything we own, and left to travel the country in a campervan. Sounds familiar, right? One thing we‚Äôve noticed since becoming immersed in this lifestyle is that a lot of people feel the same. Which is awesome news because there is such a wonderful and vibrant community of vanlifers/tiny home dwellers/nomads! So why did we decide to join?\nBeing overachievers and perfectionists, we both barreled our way straight from high school, college, into career building, with the ultimate goal of buying a house, having kids, etc. etc. - the typical ‚Äúamerican dream,‚Äù right? The problem is, we started to feel that this path just didn‚Äôt fit for us. We got married in February of 2022 and were faced with the next steps of our life: buy a house and start a family. But we both felt burnt out, overworked, and unfulfilled.\nThe day-to-day grind started to feel empty. Why were we working so hard to afford an overpriced mortgage, to raise kids we would never get enough time to spend with (as we would be working to afford said mortgage and kids)‚Ä¶? We wanted something more.\nWe felt that we needed to get back to nature, to traveling, to just LIVING again. We were living in a suburb outside of Boston, MA at the time. Kyle was working as a civil engineer, and Chandler as a registered nurse. We barely had enough time or energy for ourselves. We felt disconnected from nature, as everything required a commute in traffic to an overcrowded parking lot, just to get some fresh air and hopefully ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù before Monday rolled around again. After a trip to Burlington, VT, it just clicked for us. We didn‚Äôt know what we needed to do, but we knew something needed to change, and it needed to be drastic.\nFrom that point on, things just seemed to fall into place. We started looking into vanlife, but were discouraged by how expensive it can be to buy a van, and didn‚Äôt have the space at our apartment to work on a DIY build.\nCue Chan‚Äôs brother, Zach. During a random phone call, Chan mentioned how they were looking into vans and just wanted to travel. Zach had built a van for his daughter-in-law to use while she was doing some traveling and volunteer work, and she just happened to be selling it. On top of it, Chan‚Äôs brother was offering to help us finish the build to accommodate two people for a longer period of time. It was a no-brainer, we bought the van and spent the next few months selling almost everything we owned and giving notice to our jobs.\nIt was one of the scariest, and most exciting, things we had done. This is how we knew it was worth it - it made us feel alive again! In May, we took Amtrak from Boston to New Mexico, where Chan‚Äôs brother lives, and spent the next month getting everything ready. We set off in June and have been traveling ever since! We set up this blog as a living journal to document our experiences, and hopefully share some useful tips and info along the way!\nHow we found each other Shout out to Tinder for facilitating this beautiful love story! We matched on the app back in 2020, a month before the pandemic shut everything down. We very quickly had to figure out what mattered, and it was clear from the start that one of those things was each other.\nA global pandemic may not be the best time for a burgeoning relationship, but we weathered every storm together. It simply made us stronger and now we feel that we can get through anything together (which was certainly put to the test again when we transitioned to spending every waking hour together living in a van!)\nAfter a year of dating, we moved in together with Chan‚Äôs mom, as Chan and her mom are very close and had been living together since she moved to Boston. We all became closer than ever.\nKyle and Chan got engaged in Rockport, MA, while watching the sunset, in December, 2021. By February, 2022, the 5th to be exact, we were married. When we know what we want, we don‚Äôt waste any time! After we got engaged, it was clear that we just wanted to start our lives together. When any day could be your last, why waste any of it?\nWe wanted the day to be simple, a quiet celebration of love. We had the ceremony in our living room, with just our moms and a justice of the peace present, and we couldn‚Äôt have been happier. There were no frills, no distractions. It was a simple, wonderful day, and the perfect way to begin our adventure.\nWhy \u0026ldquo;Atoms of Us?\u0026rdquo; You may be wondering why we decided to call our blog ‚ÄúAtoms of Us.‚Äù The idea came from the passage we included in our wedding, which is an excerpt from the book The Amber Spyglass, by Phillip Pullman, which is as follows:\nI will love you forever; whatever happens. Till I die and after I die, and when I find my way out of the land of the dead, I‚Äôll drift about forever, all my atoms, till I find you again‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be looking for you, every moment, every single moment. And when we do find each other again, we‚Äôll cling together so tight that nothing and no one‚Äôll ever tear us apart. Every atom of me and every atom of you‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll live in birds and flowers and dragonflies and pine trees and in clouds and in those little specks of light you see floating in sunbeams‚Ä¶ And when they use our atoms to make new lives, they won‚Äôt just be able to take one, they‚Äôll have to take two, one of you and one of me.\nOur wedding day was one of the best days of our lives, and was intertwined with the many changes that led us on the journey we‚Äôre on now. Finding each other gave us the courage to take the risks necessary to live the life we want and this passage is very meaningful to us. When we decided to leave to travel in our van, and to document our journey along the way, the name ‚Äúatoms of us‚Äù seemed fitting, as it encompassses everything that makes us who we are - all of our values, decisions, people we meet, mistakes we make along the way. We would like to share with you some of the atoms of us, and hope we can continue growing and learning along with you.\nMarty Our chariot is named Martin (Marty for short). He is a 2002 Chevy Express van outfitted with electricity powered by a roof-mounted solar panel, bed, running water (bonus: water heater), external shower, wood countertop, fridge, and custom-welded ladder, all done by Chan‚Äôs brother, Zach. Stay tuned for a more detailed post about our van build!\nChan HI, I‚Äôm Chandler, but you can call me Chan! üòÅ I am a silly, sensitive, kind-hearted human who hopes to spread some light in this world. I‚Äôm a natural introvert and have a knack for being painfully awkward at times. I love all things autumn and spooky! Haunted houses, pumpkin spice, crunchy leaves, scary movies‚Ä¶that‚Äôs my jam! My favorite movie is Spirited Away, which I have rewatched far too many times to count. I believe that being a jack of all trades is a good thing and am always trying to expand my skill set. When I was little, I wanted to be a veterinarian by day, dancer by night (not that kind of dancer, you sicko üòâ). I took dance lessons until high school, ballet being my favorite but I basically tried them all (jazz, modern, lyrical, tap, you name it). I always had a creative side, and was involved in choir and musical theater throughout high school. I moved around a lot growing up, so the nomad lifestyle has always been a part of me. I am quiet at first, but once you get to know me, you‚Äôll see my goofy side. After getting my Bachelors of Science in Nursing at Penn State, I worked as an RN in the Boston area. I worked in an inpatient psychiatric hospital on a unit specializing in addiction, then I worked in the operating room, and lastly worked as a home care nurse specializing in mental health. Like I said, I‚Äôm always trying new things! Although I loved my patients, the system at large is deeply flawed and I felt there were many barriers preventing me from truly being there for them the way that I wished I could. I hope to still make a difference in the world and share positivity along the way! Welcome to our blog, it‚Äôs great to meet you! ü•∞\nKyle üëã Hey, I‚Äôm Kyle. I\u0026rsquo;m terrible at writing about myself. Hence, why I\u0026rsquo;ve spent most of this morning gazing out the window at trees glistening in the cool autumn sun, daydreaming about more coffee. I can be pretty unfocused when I want to be. Most of the time you‚Äôll find me deep in my head overthinking everything. But when I snap back to reality I can be fairly extroverted at times (given my social battery is charged up). This inner dichotomy is a trend through most of my life. Growing up I was a townie, born and raised in Somerville, MA. My interests bounced between sports and nerdier interests such as the pokemon and yugioh metagames, animation, and xbox live. You‚Äôd usually find my face burrowed into a gameboy or comic book if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t at the park playing basketball or stickball with friends. Yet, eventually, I found myself on a path towards being a young urban professional. After 4 years at UMass AMherst getting my Mechanical Engineering degree I switched concentrations and got a job as a Civil Engineer because of relevant internship experience. After that I spent most of my 20s doing CAD, drinking beer, bouncing from hobby to hobby, and learning to accept adulthood. After COVID I was starting to feel burnt out and ready for a change. Still in the same city I grew up in, approaching 30, and having just got my PE license at work, I was starting to feel stuck. Life was on rails and there was nothing I could do to get off the train. Lucky for me I had just married this awesome chick and jumping off the train together didn‚Äôt seem as scary as it did alone. Getting out of town to see what the rest of the world has to offer has been one of the most difficult things I‚Äôve ever done, but is also already one of the most rewarding. So I‚Äôm excited to get to share our story and what we learn along the way. Stay tuned! ü§ô\n","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://atomsofus.com/images/about-us_hu14c33cb288d7aa9b8a1f0f995e7e9f3d_699476_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp","permalink":"/about/","title":""},{"categories":null,"contents":"","date":"January 1, 1","image":"https://atomsofus.com/images/about-us_hu14c33cb288d7aa9b8a1f0f995e7e9f3d_699476_650x0_resize_q90_h2_box_2.webp","permalink":"/contact/","title":"Contact"},{"categories":null,"contents":" PRIVACY NOTICE\nLast updated September 20, 2022\nThis privacy notice for Atoms of Us (\"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\"), describes how and why we might collect, store, use, and/or share (\"process\") your information when you use our services (\"Services\"), such as when you:Visit our website at atomsofus.com, or any website of ours that links to this privacy noticeEngage with us in other related ways, including any sales, marketing, or eventsQuestions or concerns?¬†Reading this privacy notice will help you understand your privacy rights and choices.
